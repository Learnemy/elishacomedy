      </h2>
      <div class="intro" style="text-align: left;">
        <p>Hi! Iâ€™m Elisha - a Singaporean stand-up comedian and woman in tech based in the Bay Area.</p>

        <p>Iâ€™ve performed comedy across the U.S., Asia, and Europe, telling stories about what itâ€™s like to be an introverted Asian woman in loud, often white, male-dominated spaces. My style is personal, warm, and just self-aware enough to hurt a little.</p>

        <p>But I donâ€™t just want to be funnyâ€”I want to use comedy to <b>do something</b>. Thatâ€™s why I started <a href="https://www.instagram.com/goodgigglescomedy/">Good Giggles</a>, a live stand-up show that raises money for local nonprofits, and the <a href="http://averagefoundation.com//">Average Foundation</a>, which helps fund small, grassroots acts of good. Whether itâ€™s supporting housing programs or LGBTQ+ elders, the mission is simple: use laughter as a tool for change.</p>

        <p>Right now, Iâ€™m focused on growing my comedy career internationallyâ€”getting on bigger stages, making more meaningful content, and building a brand that blends humor with heart.</p>

        <p>This is where you come in.</p>

        <h2 id="bio" class="tagline"><span class="ib" style="text-transform: none; font-size: 0.6em">Part-time | Remote | ~10 hrs/week to start (potential to grow to 20 hrs/week)</span></h2>

        <p>I'm looking for someone to help grow my online presence on IG, TikTok, and YouTube, get the word out about my shows, drive ticket sales, and raise awareness of my other projects. You'll be a behind-the-scenes partner helping a comedian (me!) do more shows, tell better stories online, and build a comedy career with purpose.</p>

        <h2 id="bio" class="tagline"><span class="ib" style="text-transform: none; font-size: 0.6em">Youâ€™ll Be Doing Things Like:</span></h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Promoting live shows from start to finish</b> - designing posters in Canva, writing event descriptions, posting on event sites and social media, and running organic and paid campaigns on IG/FB (including captions, targeting, and creative assets) to drive ticket sales</li>
          <li><b>Tracking viral trends and memes</b> to suggest fun, weird, or smart content ideas that could work as short-form comedy â€” think YouTube Shorts, TikTok, Reels, and sketch-style content.</li>
          <li><b>Editing short-form videos</b> in CapCut to match my tone and aesthetic (Check out <a href="https://www.instagram.com/elishatan/)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@elishatan</a> for my style)</li>
          <li><b>Growing my social media following</b>by analyzing my account and running strategic campaigns on IG/FB</li>
          <li><b>Researching and pitching shows/producer</b>to get me booked on shows</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="bio" class="tagline"><span class="ib" style="text-transform: none; font-size: 0.6em">Who You Are:</span></h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Independent, organized, and takes initiative</li>
          <li>Proficient in Canva and CapCut</li>
          <li>Have a good eye for content and understand what makes something work</li>
          <li>Care about storytelling and the impact it can make (bonus if you love stand-up or are part of the creative world)</li>
          <li>Excited to grow alongside a comedianâ€”helping shape a career, not just manage a calendar</li>
          <li>Extra bonus: Youâ€™re based in an emerging marketâ€”I love supporting women from underrepresented places</li>
        </ul>


        <h2 id="bio" class="tagline"><span class="ib" style="text-transform: none; font-size: 0.6em">Letâ€™s Work Together</span></h2>
        <p>This is more than just a task-based jobâ€”itâ€™s a chance to be part of something thatâ€™s growing, meaningful, and occasionally unhinged (in a good way). If youâ€™re interested, send me:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A short intro about you and why youâ€™d be a good fit</li>
          <li>Your hourly rate (in USD)</li>
          <li>Examples of relevant work (social posts, video edits, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
